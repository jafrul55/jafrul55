Hi there! My name is Jafrul Alam Tusar, and I am a passionate Python developer with a strong focus on building web applications using the Django framework. I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge of Django, Python, and related technologies to deliver the best solutions for my clients.

I have a solid foundation in software engineering principles, including object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, and software design patterns. I am also proficient in working with MySQL databases, and I have experience in integrating Django applications with other technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
